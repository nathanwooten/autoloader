# The Autoloader

Changes made after the latest February release have been rolled back temporarily and the previous version has been turned into the first official release of the Autoloader under v2.00. Changes made will be rolled forward again as necessary and changes will continue in new version 3+ versions of the autoloader.

As well as the previous features now autoloads a directory of functions if required, and is no longer instantiated repeatedly, but is meant to be a singleton.
